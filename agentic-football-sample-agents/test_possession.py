"""Temp verification: possession disambiguation (home P3 vs away P3 both idx 3).

Before the fix, possession lookup matched the FIRST player with the idx —
always the home one — so away holders were misattributed and hasBall was
idx-only (true for both teams). This drove the dribble-without-shooting loss.
