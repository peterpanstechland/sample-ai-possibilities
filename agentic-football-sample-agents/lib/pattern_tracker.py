"""In-process cross-tick pattern tracker — compact scouting memory.

Accumulates cheap counters over game-state snapshots in the warm AgentCore
runtime (zero network calls, microsecond cost) and distills them into a short
SCOUTING REPORT block for the LLM prompt. This replaces replaying raw
conversation history, which grows the context unboundedly and buries the
signal (which side opponents attack, who their main threat is) in noise.

A new match is detected when gameTime jumps backwards; counters reset.
