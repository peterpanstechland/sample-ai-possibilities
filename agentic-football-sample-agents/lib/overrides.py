"""Post-LLM tactical overrides — prompts suggest, code enforces.

Match evidence (aggressive team vs bot): 207/370 commands were MOVE_TO, 101
PRESS_BALL, 0 MARK — despite prompts ordering "MARK when a teammate presses".
The LLM answered 100% of ticks (fallback never ran), so every rule that lived
only in the prompt or the fallback was effectively optional. This module makes
the match-deciding rules deterministic:

  1. blast — GK/DEF possession is ALWAYS an instant full-power shot at the
     clearest part of the goal frame: clearance + shot in one, no range limit
     (skipped on set-piece play modes so restarts keep their mechanics);
     with build_from_back (iter-11), an UNPRESSURED GK/DEF with a clear lane
     to an advanced teammate plays the outlet pass instead — six matches of
     KPI history showed 92-98% of our shots were 45+ hoofs and the team never
     held the ball inside shooting range, so blind blasts just fed the
     opponent's attack;
  2. shot enforcement — MID/FWD holding in range with a clear lane ALWAYS
     shoot (an LLM shot at a covered corner is re-aimed at the open one);
  3. long shot — 45-52 out with the opponent GK off his line and a clear
     lane: shoot the open frame (the only long shot worth taking);
  4. counter — deep possession under a high press (3+ opponents in our half)
     or a panic blast from out of range becomes ONE fast THROUGH pass to the
     most advanced open forward; no outlet -> carry up the wing;
  5. phantom — SHOOT/PASS without the ball wastes the tick; designated player
     presses instead, everyone else takes a real defensive job;
  5b. attack support (iter-11b) — while a TEAMMATE holds the ball, MID/FWDs
     may not MARK/hold stance/drift backwards (tournament data: FWD1 took 0
     shots and MID 2 across ~4 matches while spending 80-91% of ticks on
     MOVE_TO+MARK); anything but an advancing run becomes the wide support
     spot so the attackers stretch the box and arrive for the shot;
  6. no-chase — a non-designated player pressing/chasing is rewritten to a
     MARK on the nearest passing option or a compact-line position;
  7. anchor clamp — defensive-phase MOVE_TO far off the role's ball-shifted
     compact line becomes a real defensive job (line drops deeper when the
     opponent commits bodies forward);
  8. cutback (iter-12) — in range with every shot lane blocked, the carrier
     stops dribbling into the block: cut the ball back to a teammate with an
     open shot, else take the computed lateral sidestep at dribble pace;
  9. carry cap (iter-12) — dribble targets clamp at the box edge and sprint
     drops near the target (~1s of state staleness made carriers overrun to
     the byline, user-observed);
 10. ball-winning (iter-12, user: "defense only marks") — the designated
     presser inside tackle range SLIDE_TACKLEs the carrier and INTERCEPTs
     loose balls; the GK smothers loose balls in our box instead of phantom
     kicking (15-17 SHOOTs/match with hb=0 in the last two losses);
 11. route-one launch (iter-12b) — a pressed GK/DEF with every GROUND outlet
     shut lofts an AERIAL to the most advanced forward instead of blasting to
     nobody (validation match: far_shot_ratio 1.0, forwards 0 shots — the
     press trapped us into 33 blind clearances and the strikers never touched
     the ball in range).

Only teams that pass an OverrideConfig into create_invoke_handler get this
behaviour — other teams' pipelines are byte-for-byte unchanged.
