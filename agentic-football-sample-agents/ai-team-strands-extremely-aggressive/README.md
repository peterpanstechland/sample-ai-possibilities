# AI Team (Strands) — Extremely Aggressive

Five AI agents that each control a single player in a 5v5 soccer match with an
**extremely aggressive** play style. Every player prioritizes attacking, the goalkeeper
pushes forward as a sweeper-keeper, and defensive behavior is minimized across all agents.

Built with [Strands Agents SDK](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) and deployed to
[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/).

## Strategy

- **GK**: Sweeper-keeper — pushes to halfway line, shoots if near goal
- **DEF**: Attacking defender — joins every attack, shoots from distance, rarely tracks back
- **DEF (classic)**: Optional second defender runtime (`agg_def_classic_agent`) — portal default prompt, pure LLM with no code overrides; deploy with `./deploy-all.sh ai-def-classic`
- **MID**: Second striker — shoots first, passes forward only, never defends
- **FWD1**: Pure goal scorer — camps near goal, shoots at every opportunity
- **FWD2**: Pure goal scorer — same as FWD1, stays on right side
